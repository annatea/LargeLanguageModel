Exploring the use of Large Language Models on Twitter Data

The proposed project entails developing a machine learning model to classify tweets related to the Artsakh war into distinct categories based on their sentiment or stance towards the conflict. The aim is to comprehend how different groups of people perceive the conflict and to identify potential sources of misinformation or propaganda.

## Project Steps
Preprocess the data: Depending on the quality of the data, clean up, remove duplicates, and filter out irrelevant tweets that do not pertain to the Artsakh conflict. This can involve using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.

Label the data: After preprocessing the data, label each tweet based on its sentiment or stance towards the conflict. This can involve manually labeling a subset of the data or using automated methods such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

Train a classification model: With the labeled data, train a machine learning model to classify tweets into different categories based on their sentiment or stance towards the conflict. This can involve using supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks. Most possibly, a pre-trained model will be used that will later be fine-tuned on this project's dataset.

Evaluate the model: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This will give an idea of how well the model is able to classify tweets into different categories.

Deploy the model: After evaluating the model and ensuring its accuracy, deploy it to a web service or application to allow users to explore the results in an interactive manner.

This project has the potential to help understand how different groups of people perceive the conflict and identify potential sources of misinformation or propaganda. It can also be used to monitor public sentiment towards the conflict over time and identify emerging trends or issues.
