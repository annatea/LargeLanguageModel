Exploring the use of Large Language Models on Twitter Data

The proposed project entails developing a machine learning model to classify tweets related to Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3 into distinct categories based on their sentiment or stance. The aim is to comprehend how different groups of people perceive the movie and to identify potential sources of misinformation or spoilers.

## Project Steps

Getting the data from Twitter API: Using Twitter API collect tweets related to the movie Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3 from users who were actively discussing the movie and its related topics during the period of data collection.

Preprocess the data: Depending on the quality of the data, clean up, remove duplicates, and filter out irrelevant tweets. This can involve using NLP techniques such as  hashtag, stop-word removal, tokenization, stemming, and part-of-speech tagging.

Label the data: After preprocessing the data, label each tweet based on its sentiment or stance towards the movie. This can involve manually labeling a subset of the data or using automated methods such as sentiment analysis or topic modeling.

Train a classification model: With the labeled data, train a machine learning model to classify tweets into different categories based on their sentiment or stance towards the movie. This can involve using supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines, or neural networks. A pre-trained model will be used that will later be fine-tuned on this project's dataset.

Evaluate the model: Once the model is trained, evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This will give an idea of how well the model is able to classify tweets into different categories.

Deploy the model: After evaluating the model and ensuring its accuracy, deploy it to a web service or application to allow users to explore the results in an interactive manner.

This project has the potential to help understand how different groups of people perceive the Guardians of the Galaxy vol.3 movie and identify potential sources of misinformation or spoilers. It can also be used to monitor public sentiment towards the movie over time and identify emerging trends or issues.
